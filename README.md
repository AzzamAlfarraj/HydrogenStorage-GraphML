# MOF Feature Extraction and Model Evaluation

This repository provides scripts to extract spectral and nonspectral features from MOF adjacency matrices, merge those features with experimental labels, and evaluate regression models predicting hydrogen storage capacity.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Input files including CIF names, label CSV, and adjacency matrices.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for feature extraction, merging labels, and model evaluation.
- `outputs/`: Generated CSVs and model evaluation results.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
